An insurance policy has the following main fields:
- id
- clientId
- productId
- carrierId
- startDate
- endDate
Client Relationship.
We analyze existing policies: we order all policies in ascending order by start date,￼and then process each policy. For each policy we set the Client Relationship to:
- Renewed - if there is a policy for the same (Client, Product) prior to the start date of this policy;
- Expanded - if there is a policy for the same (Client) for a product other than the product of this policy, prior to the start date of this policy and it is not Renewed;
- New – if there are no policies for this (Client) prior to the start date of this policy;
Task: Write a method that has 2 parameters:
- policy - the policy for that we want to get Client Relationship
- policySet - all policies
and returns Client Relationship for the given policy.
